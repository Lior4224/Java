0. The base is how many times greater the place value gets from right to left. For example, in base-10, in the number 345, the right most digit (5) has place value 1,
the digit immediately to its left (4) has place value 10, and the leftmost digit (3) has place value 100. It also states the amount of unique digits in the number 
system.

1. Binary is a base-2 number system. It is useful for computing because computers are made up of switches that are either on or off (1 or 0). Since binary only 
uses 0 or 1, a computer can easily store and use the data by reading 1s and 0s as ons and offs.

Binary to Decimal Algorithm

1) Create variables "power" and "sum"
2) Set power = 0
3) Set sum = 0
4) While n has at least 1 digit:
4.1) Create variable "dig"
4.2) Set dig to last digit of n
4.3) Add dig * (2^power) to sum
4.4) Add 1 to power
4.5) Remove the last digit of n
5) Return sum

Decimal to Binary Algorithm

1) Define f(x)
2) If n is not 0:
2.1) f(n/2) 
2.2) Print n%2
